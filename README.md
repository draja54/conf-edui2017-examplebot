# edUi Conference 2017 Presentations

### Bots for the Conversation UI

Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack, WhatsApp: messaging has become the heart and soul of the mobile device, and both Microsoft and Facebook have stressed the emergence of the conversation space as the next big frontier for the Internet. With the progress on artificial intelligence services, this means the growth of bots.

But what exactly is a bot, and how can it help you? This session will walk you through the bot basics and show you how easy it is to build a bot using the Microsoft Bot Framework. From start to finish, you’ll hear about the pieces you need to build a bot and launch it for various communication services.

Conversation is the next user interface.

What you’ll learn:

* The value of bots in the education space: providing rich, adaptable experiences for your library or website users.

* How to use the Microsoft Bot Framework and Microsoft’s connector APIs to launch a bot for Skype, Facebook, web chat, and more.

* How natural language processors like LUIS can add artificial intelligence to your bot with very little code from you.

* Stream audio and video, send directions, send specialized UI components called cards, and accept files for processing…straight from the bot!

### Building Progressive Web Apps

Mobile devices have created a walled garden of mobile apps that have forced teams to maintain multiple projects to build for each device or to rely on wrappers and compilers to get the native experience. If only there was a way to use the power and knowledge of the web to build powerful mobile web applications with device interaction! There is: progressive web apps (PWAs).

With PWAs, developers can take advantage of HTML5 and the new HTML5 JavaScript APIs to put together power mobile web applications that can do everything a native app can do, without using Ionic, Cordova, or some other third-party compiler.

What you’ll learn:

* How a manifest file can prompt users to install an app to their home screen and launch it in standalone mode.

* How a service worker can be used to preload images and assets and prepare the app for offline mode, while offering background sync capabilities.

* How the Fetch API works as an intercept to serve data from a cache or a live API request with ease.

* How to get a mobile web application to serve push notifications to a device just like a native app.

* How to access native hardware from the mobile web, including location, audio, and camera features.
